# 1vishen-Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio site! This is a showcase of my work, skills, and projects. The site is designed with a focus on user experience, responsive design, and functionality.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: The site includes a dynamic theme that changes based on the time of day. Users can manually adjust the light/dark mode with a horizontal clock slider.
- **Time-Synced Theme**: The theme automatically reflects the current time in the user's location.
- **Project Showcase**: Highlights of my recent projects, including web development, machine learning, and hardware-based projects.
